        <h3 class="font-bold">What's Capusule Cooking?</h3>
        <p>For busy professionals who must save time and want to save money, 
            <strong>Capsule Cooking </strong> is a new meal prep service that 
            <strong>reduces time </strong>  in the kitchen to just two hours per week.</p>
        <p> Unlike current meal prep apps, <strong>Capsule Cooking</strong> 
    offers curated capsule recipes that cross-utilize ingredients between recipes, 
        minimizing food waste and time spent prepping and cooking.</p>

        <h3 class="font-bold">What are capusules?</h3>
        <p>Capsules are collections of recipes that are deigned to be cooked simultaneously. 
        By curating capsule recipes that can be prepped and cooked simultaneously, 
        FreshPrep aims to give people back that one resource we all wish would not slip by so quickly: time. </p>
